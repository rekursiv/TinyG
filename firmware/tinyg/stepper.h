/* 
 *	Coordinated motion (line drawing) is performed using a classic 
 *	Bresenham DDA as per reprap and grbl. A number of additional steps 
 *	are taken to optimize interpolation and pulse train accuracy.
 *
 *	- The DDA accepts and processes fractional motor steps. Steps are 
 *	  passed to the move queue as doubles, and do not need to be integer
 *	  values. The DDA implements fractional steps and interpolation by 
 *	  extending the counter range downward using the DDA_SUBSTEPS setting. 
 *
 *	- The DDA is not used as a 'ramp' for acceleration management. Accel
 *	  is computed as 3rd order (controlled jerk) equations that generate 
 *	  accel/decel segments to the DDA in much the same way arc drawing
 *	  is approximated. The DDA runs at a constant rate for each segment,
 *	  up to a maximum of 50 Khz step rate.
 *
 *	- The DDA rate for a segment is set to an integer multiple of the 
 *	  step freqency of the fastest motor (major axis). This amount of 
 *	  overclocking is controlled by the DDA_OVERCLOCK value, typically 16x.
 *	  A minimum DDA rate is enforced that prevents overflowing the 16 bit 
 *	  DDA timer PERIOD value. The DDA timer always runs at 32 Mhz: the 
 *	  prescaler is not used. Various methods are used to keep the numbers 
 *	  in range for long lines. See _st_set_f_dda() for details.
 *
 *	- Pulse phasing is preserved between segments if possible. This makes
 *	  for smoother motion, particularly at very low speeds and short 
 *	  segment lengths (avoids pulse jitter). Phase continuity is achieved 
 *	  by simply not resetting the DDA counters across segments. In some 
 *	  cases the differences between timer values across segments are too 
 *	  large for this to work, and you risk motor stalls due to pulse 
 *	  starvation. These cases are detected and the counters are reset 
 *	  to prevent stalling.
 *
 *  - Pulse phasing is also helped by minimizing the time spent loading 
 *	  the next move segment. To this end as much as possible about that 
 *	  move is pre-computed during move execution. Also, all moves are 
 *	  loaded from the interrupt level, avoiding the need for mutual 
 *	  exclusion locking or volatiles (which slow things down).

/* DDA overclocking
 * 	Overclocking multiplies the step rate of the fastest axis (major axis) 
 *	by an integer value up to the DDA_OVERCLOCK value. This makes the 
 *	interpolation of the non-major axes more accurate than simply setting
 *	the DDA to the speed of the major axis; and allows the DDA to run at 
 *	less than the max frequency when possible.
 *
 *	Set to 0 to disable.
 *
 *	NOTE: TinyG doesn't use tunable overclocking any more. It just overclocks
 *	at the fastest sustainable step rate which is about 50 Khz for the xmega.
 *	This minimizes the aliasing on minor axes at minimal impact to the major 
 *	axis. The DDA overclock setting and associated code are left in for historical
 *	purposes and in case we ever want to go back to pure overclocking.
 *
 *	Setting this value to 0 has the effect of telling the optimizer to take out
 *	entire code regions that are not called if this value is zero. So they are 
 *	left in for historical purposes and not commented out. These regions are noted.

 *	much less than the old counter you must reset it or risk motor stalls.
